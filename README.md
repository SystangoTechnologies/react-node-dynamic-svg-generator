Generating SVG With React
=====================
### Demo URL:
https://react-node-svg-generator.herokuapp.com/api/svg?header=React%20Node&title=Dynamic&subHeader=SVG

Here try changing query params:
`header`
`title`
`subHeader`

You'll be able to see dyamic content rendering in SVG.

This project was bootstrapped with React, Node with Express framework.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://react-node-svg-generator.herokuapp.com/api/svg?header=React11%20Node&title=Dynamic&subHeader=SVG] to view it in the browser.

*Note: We are making dynamic SVG utility and consume an API with request parameter to make it dynamic, confugurable!*

### Endpoints

```
http://react-node-svg-generator.herokuapp.com/api/svg

--to return svg with contents

```

Here we can even override the current `SVG` template, in [https://github.com/SystangoTechnologies/react-node-dynamic-svg-generator/tree/master/app/public/scripts/app.js], so there can be multiple cases that can be handled by forking this repo and customising it.
